# ANTI-POACHING-DETECTION-SYSTEM
This project implements an AI-powered Anti-Poaching Detection System using YOLO for real-time identification of guns, hunters, and poachers from video or webcam. On detecting danger, it triggers alerts with snapshots via email, optional sound and popup warnings, and saves annotated video output through a user-friendly GUI.
